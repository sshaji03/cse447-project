Display or execute commands from the history list. fc is used to list or edit and re-execute commands from the history list. FIRST and LAST can be numbers specifying the range, or FIRST can be a string, which means the most recent command beginning with that string. Options: -e ENAME\tselect which editor to use. Default is FCEDIT, then EDITOR, \t\tthen vi -l \tlist lines instead of editing -n\tomit line numbers when listing -r\treverse the order of the lines (newest listed first) With the `fc -s [pat=rep ...] [command]' format, COMMAND is re-executed after the substitution OLD=NEW is performed. A useful alias to use with this is r='fc -s', so that typing `r cc' runs the last command beginning with `cc' and typing `r' re-executes the last command. Exit Status: Returns success or status of executed command; non-zero if an error occurs.

Here, you have translated from the sentence in < the language you have translated from > and you created a link to that one. I think this is the sentence in < the language you want to translate from > that you wanted to translate. To do this, you must first click on the sentence in < the language you want to translate from > before clicking on the translation button. The sentence that you are translating must ALWAYS stand on top of the pile (in the largest typeface) and it is the only one visible at the time you're editing your translation, and that is on purpose to avoid influence on your translation, as in Tatoeba, sentences are linked by twos, not as blocks, since a sentence may have several different translations in the same language!
