This takes an image and makes it melt. You've no doubt seen this effect before, but no screensaver would really be complete without it. It works best if there's something colorful visible. Warning, if the effect continues after the screen saver is off, seek medical attention. Written by David Wald, Vivek Khera, Jamie Zawinski, and Vince Levey; 1993.

If supported, this option allows you to hear audible clicks from your computer's speakers when you press the keys on your keyboard. This might be useful if your keyboard does not have mechanical keys, or if the sound that the keys make is very soft. You can change the loudness of the key click feedback by dragging the slider button or by clicking the up/ down arrows on the spin box. Setting the volume to 0% turns off the key click.

Here you can choose a keyboard model. This setting is independent of your keyboard layout and refers to the "hardware" model, i. e. the way your keyboard is manufactured. Modern keyboards that come with your computer usually have two extra keys and are referred to as "104-key" models, which is probably what you want if you do not know what kind of keyboard you have.

This option forces a specific DPI value for fonts. It may be useful when the real DPI of the hardware is not detected properly and it is also often misused when poor quality fonts are used that do not look well with DPI values other than 96 or 120 DPI. The use of this option is generally discouraged. For selecting proper DPI value a better option is explicitly configuring it for the whole X server if possible (e. g. DisplaySize in xorg. conf or adding -dpi value to ServerLocalArgs= in $KDEDIR/ share/ config/ kdm/ kdmrc). When fonts do not render properly with real DPI value better fonts should be used or configuration of font hinting should be checked.

Now you have to dig to get the gold! Just use the left and right mouse buttons to dig left or right of the hero's position. The hero can then jump into and through the hole he has dug. He can also dig several holes in a row and run sideways through the dug holes. Be careful though. After a while the holes close up and you can get trapped and killed. In the third box down, you have to dig two holes, jump in and quickly dig one more, to get through two layers. On the right, you have to dig three, then two then one to get through. There are also two little puzzles to work out along the way. Good luck! By the way, you can dig through brick, but not concrete.

This displays 2D projections of the sequence of 3D objects which are the projections of the 4D analog to the cube: as a square is composed of four lines, each touching two others; and a cube is composed of six squares, each touching four others; a hypercube is composed of eight cubes, each touching six others. To make it easier to visualize the rotation, it uses a different color for the edges of each face. Do n't think about it too long, or your brain will melt. See also "polytopes" for a more general version of this using OpenGL. http: / /en. wikipedia. org/ wiki/ Hypercube http: / /en. wikipedia. org/ wiki/ Regular_polytope Written by Joe Keane, Fritz Mueller, and Jamie Zawinski; 1992.

Regular Expression Editor What you are currently looking at is an editor for Regular Expressions. The upper part in the middle is the editing area, the lower part is a verification window where you can try your regular expressions right away. The row of buttons is the editing actions. This is actually very similar to common drawing programs. Select an editing tool to start editing your regular expression, and press the mouse button in the editing area where you want this item inserted. For a more detailed description of this editor see the info pages What is a regular expression? If you do not know what a regular expression is, then it might be a good idea to read the introduction to regular expressions.

This part of the backgammon board is the home. Depending on the direction of the game, one of the homes contains the dice and the other one contains checkers that have been moved off the board. Checkers can never be moved away from the home. If this home contains the dice and the current state of the game permits this, double clicking on the dice will roll them. Moreover, the cube might be placed on the home bar and if it can be doubled, double clicking it will do so.

Messages sometimes come in both formats. This option controls whether you want the HTML part or the plain text part to be displayed. Displaying the HTML part makes the message look better, but at the same time increases the risk of security holes being exploited. Displaying the plain text part loses much of the message's formatting, but makes it almost impossible to exploit security holes in the HTML renderer (Konqueror). The option below guards against one common misuse of HTML messages, but it cannot guard against security issues that were not known at the time this version of KMail was written. It is therefore advisable to not prefer HTML to plain text. Note: You can set this option on a per-folder basis from the Folder menu of KMail's main window.

Here you can get some assistance in setting up KMail's filter rules to use some commonly-known anti-virus tools. The wizard can detect those tools on your computer as well as create filter rules to classify messages using these tools and to separate messages containing viruses. The wizard will not take any existing filter rules into consideration: it will always append the new rules. Warning: As KMail appears to be frozen during the scan of the messages for viruses, you may encounter problems with the responsiveness of KMail because anti-virus tool operations are usually time consuming; please consider deleting the filter rules created by the wizard to get back to the former behavior.

Please note that this feature can cause some POP3 servers that do not support pipelining to send corrupted mail; this is configurable, though, because some servers support pipelining but do not announce their capabilities. To check whether your POP3 server announces pipelining support use the "Check What the Server Supports" button at the bottom of the Security tab in this dialog; if your server does not announce it, but you want more speed, then you should do some testing first by sending yourself a batch of mail and downloading it.
For some reason I couldn’t select unifont even though I’ve installed it, so I had to build dmenu with the xft patch to get Chinese menu entries displayed correctly.

Login Manager In this module you can configure the various aspects of the KDE Login Manager. This includes the look and feel as well as the users that can be selected for login. Note that you can only make changes if you run the module with superuser rights. If you have not started the KDE System Settings with superuser rights (which is absolutely the right thing to do, by the way), click on the Modify button to acquire superuser rights. You will be asked for the superuser password. General On this tab page, you can configure parts of the Login Manager's look, and which language it should use. The language settings made here have no influence on the user's language settings. Dialog Here you can configure the look of the "classical" dialog based mode if you have chosen to use it. Background If you want to set a special background for the dialog based login screen, this is where to do it. Themes Here you can specify a theme to be used by the Login Manager. Shutdown Here you can specify who is allowed to shutdown/ reboot the machine and whether a boot manager should be used. Users On this tab page, you can select which users the Login Manager will offer you for logging in. Convenience Here you can specify a user to be logged in automatically, users not needing to provide a password to log in, and other convenience features. Note, that these settings are security holes by their nature, so use them very carefully.

If supported, this option allows you to hear audible clicks from your computer's speakers when you press the keys on your keyboard. This might be useful if your keyboard does not have mechanical keys, or if the sound that the keys make is very soft. You can change the loudness of the key click feedback by dragging the slider button or by clicking the up/ down arrows on the spin box. Setting the volume to 0% turns off the key click.

Printers The KDE printing manager is part of KDEPrint which is the interface to the real print subsystem of your Operating System (OS). Although it does add some additional functionality of its own to those subsystems, KDEPrint depends on them for its functionality. Spooling and filtering tasks, especially, are still done by your print subsystem, or the administrative tasks (adding or modifying printers, setting access rights, etc.) What print features KDEPrint supports is therefore heavily dependent on your chosen print subsystem. For the best support in modern printing, the KDE Printing Team recommends a CUPS based printing system.

More precisely, this setting overrides any specified host and port part in a LDAP URL and will also be used if host and port have been omitted from the URL. Other LDAP servers will be used only if the connection to the "proxy" failed. The syntax is "HOST" or "HOST: PORT". If PORT is omitted, port 389 (standard LDAP port) is used.

Message Disposition Notification Policy MDNs are a generalization of what is commonly called read receipt. The message author requests a disposition notification to be sent and the receiver's mail program generates a reply from which the author can learn what happened to his message. Common disposition types include displayed (i. e. read), deleted and dispatched (e. g. forwarded). The following options are available to control KMail's sending of MDNs: Ignore: Ignores any request for disposition notifications. No MDN will ever be sent automatically (recommended). Ask: Answers requests only after asking the user for permission. This way, you can send MDNs for selected messages while denying or ignoring them for others. Deny: Always sends a denied notification. This is only slightly better than always sending MDNs. The author will still know that the messages has been acted upon, he just cannot tell whether it was deleted or read etc. Always send: Always sends the requested disposition notification. That means that the author of the message gets to know when the message was acted upon and, in addition, what happened to it (displayed, deleted, etc.). This option is strongly discouraged, but since it makes much sense e. g. for customer relationship management, it has been made available.

Selecting the correct encoding is very important as if you have files that have some other encoding than the selected one, after a replace you may damage those files. In case you do not know the encoding of your files, select utf8 and enable the creation of backup files. This setting will autodetect utf8 and utf16 files, but the changed files will be converted to utf8.

Hide user ID: Checking this option will remove the keyid of the recipient from all encrypted packets. The advantage: traffic analysis of the encrypted packets cannot be performed as easily because the recipient is unknown. The disadvantage: the receiver of the encrypted packets is forced to try all secret keys before being able to decrypt the packets. This can be a lengthy process depending on the number of secret keys the receiver holds.

Service Manager This module allows you to have an overview of all plugins of the KDE Daemon, also referred to as KDE Services. Generally, there are two types of service: Services invoked at startup Services called on demand The latter are only listed for convenience. The startup services can be started and stopped. In Administrator mode, you can also define whether services should be loaded at startup. Use this with care: some services are vital for KDE; do not deactivate services if you do not know what you are doing.

The transport encoding of this part: normally, you do not need to change this, since %1 will use a decent default encoding, depending on the MIME type; yet, sometimes, you can significantly reduce the size of the resulting message, e. g. if a PostScript file does not contain binary data, but consists of pure text -- in this case, choosing "quoted-printable" over the default "base64" will save up to 25% in resulting message size.

List of all Callers This list shows all functions calling the current selected one, either directly or with several functions in-between on the stack; the number of functions in-between plus one is called the Distance (e. g. for function A, B, C there exists a call from A to C when A calls B and B calls C, i. e. A = > B = > C. The distance here is 2). Absolute cost shown is the cost spent in the selected function while a listed function is active; relative cost is the percentage of all cost spent in the selected function while the listed one is active. The cost graphic shows logarithmic percentage with a different color for each distance. As there can be many calls from the same function, the distance column sometimes shows the range of distances for all calls happening; then, in parentheses, there is the medium distance, i. e. the distance where most of the call costs happened. Selecting a function makes it the current selected one of this information panel. If there are two panels (Split mode), the function of the other panel is changed instead.

The PV_ANNUITY() function returns the present value of an annuity or stream of payments. For example: a "million dollar" lottery ticket that pays $50,000 a year for 20 years, with an interest rate of 5%, is actually worth PV_ANNUITY(50000; 0.05; 20) or $623,111. This function assumes that payments are made at the end of each period.

You do not know anything about encryption? No problem, simply create yourself a key pair in the key management window. Then, export your public key and mail it to your friends. Ask them to do the same and import their public keys. Finally, to send an encrypted message, type it in the KGpg editor, then click & quot; encryptquot;. Choose your friend key and click & quot; encryptquot; again. The message will be encrypted, ready to be sent by email.

Invitations are normally sent as attachments to a mail. This switch changes the invitation mails to be sent in the text of the mail instead; this is necessary to send invitations and replies to Microsoft Outlook. But, when you do this, you no longer get descriptive text that mail programs can read; so, to people who have email programs that do not understand the invitations, the resulting messages look very odd. People that have email programs that do understand invitations will still be able to work with this.

This graph gives you an overview of the usage of physical memory in your system. Most operating systems (including Linux) will use as much of the available physical memory as possible as disk cache, to speed up the system performance. This means that if you have a small amount of Free Physical Memory and a large amount of Disk Cache Memory, your system is well configured.

This is a shell script that grabs a frame of video from the system's video input, and then uses some PBM filters (chosen at random) to manipulate and recombine the video frame in various ways (edge detection, subtracting the image from a rotated version of itself, etc.) Then it displays that image for a few seconds, and does it again.

In the Netherlands, it is the custom that, when during the construction of a house the highest point has been reached and the roof is ready for tiling, the client treats the construction workers to so-called "tile beer" to celebrate this. A flag is then placed on the ridge of the house. If the client is too stingy to treat, not a flag, but a broom is placed.

Well, it has been nice and easy up to now, but the game would be no fun without enemies. They are after the gold too: worse still they are after you! You die if they catch you, but maybe you will have a few lives left and can start again. You can handle enemies by running away, digging a hole or luring them into part of the playing area where they get stranded. If an enemy falls into a hole, he gives up any gold he is carrying, then gets stuck in the hole for a time and climbs out. If the hole closes while he is in it, he dies and reappears somewhere else on the screen. You can deliberately kill enemies by digging several holes in a row. More importantly, you can run over an enemy's head. You should do that right at the start of this level. Dig a hole, trap the enemy, wait for him to fall all the way in, then run over him, with the other enemy in hot pursuit... If you are feeling stressed, you can hit the Pause key at any time (default P or Esc) and take a break. Hit it again when you wish to continue.

Choose the storage format of the groupware folders. The default format is to use the ical (for calendar folders) and vcard (for address book folders) standards. This format makes all Kontact features available. The Kolab XML format uses a custom model that matches more closely the one used in Outlook. This format gives better Outlook compatibility, when using a Kolab server or a compatible solution.

Regular expression to find the type of the element. The pattern is searched on the result of the DefinitionRx match and the first captured area will hold the element type. Example (simplified): DefinitionRx=\\$+([a-zA-Z]+)=new\\\\s[a-zA-Z]+; TypeRx=new\\\\s([a-zA-Z]+); This will match strings like $fooObj=new foo;. Now this string is searched and it will find new foo;, where foo is the first captured text (the regular expression matching foo is between brackets). So the type of $fooObj is foo.

Key Server: A Key Server is a centralized repository of PGP/ GnuPG keys connected to the Internet which can be conveniently accessed in order to obtain or deposit keys. Select from the drop down list to specify which key server should be used. Often these keys are held by people whom the user has never met and as such the authenticity is dubious at best. Refer to the GnuPG manual covering "Web-of-Trust" relationships to find out how GnuPG works around the problem of verifying authenticity.

This is an exercise in moving around. Follow the track of gold nuggets until the ladder pops up at the right. The hero can only follow the mouse along simple paths (like _ _BAR_ L or U), so be careful not to get too far ahead of him. DANGER: Try not to fall off the ladder or bar into the concrete pit at the bottom right. If you do get trapped there, the only way out is to kill the hero (press key Q for quit) and start the level again.

The Parts Overview A trace consists of multiple trace parts when there are several profile data files from one profile run. The Trace Part Overview dockable shows these, horizontally ordered in execution time; the rectangle sizes are proportional to the total cost spent in the parts. You can select one or several parts to constrain all costs shown to these parts only. The parts are further subdivided: there is a partitioning and an callee split mode: Partitioning: You see the partitioning into groups for a trace part, according to the group type selected. E. g. if ELF object groups are selected, you see colored rectangles for each used ELF object (shared library or executable), sized according to the cost spent therein. Callee: A rectangle showing the inclusive cost of the current selected function in the trace part is shown. This is split up into smaller rectangles to show the costs of its callees.

The LOOKUP function looks up the first parameter in the lookup vector. It returns a value in the result Vector with the same index as the matching value in the lookup vector. If value is not in the lookup vector it takes the next lower one. If no value in the lookup vector matches an error is returned. The lookup vector must be in ascending order and lookup and result vector must have the same size. Numeric values, string and boolean values are recognized. Comparison between strings is case-insensitive.

File Associations This module allows you to choose which applications are associated with a given type of file. File types are also referred to as MIME types (MIME is an acronym which stands for "Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions"). A file association consists of the following: Rules for determining the MIME-type of a file, for example the filename pattern *. png, which means'all files with names that end in. png ', is associated with the MIME type "image/ png"; A short description of the MIME-type, for example the description of the MIME type "image/ png" is simply'PNG image'; An icon to be used for displaying files of the given MIME-type, so that you can easily identify the type of file in a file manager or file-selection dialog (at least for the types you use often); A list of the applications which can be used to open files of the given MIME-type -- if more than one application can be used then the list is ordered by priority. You may be surprised to find that some MIME types have no associated filename patterns; in these cases, KDE is able to determine the MIME-type by directly examining the contents of the file.

Man has many wishes that he does not really wish to fulfil, and it would be a misunderstanding to suppose the contrary. He wants them to remain wishes, they have value only in his imagination; their fulfilment would be a bitter disappointment to him. Such a desire is the desire for eternal life. If it were fulfilled, man would become thoroughly sick of living eternally, and yearn for death.

Local Network Browsing Here you setup your "Network Neighborhood". You can use either the LISa daemon and the lan: / ioslave, or the ResLISa daemon and the rlan: / ioslave. About the LAN ioslave configuration: If you select it, the ioslave, if available, will check whether the host supports this service when you open this host. Please note that paranoid people might consider even this to be an attack. Always means that you will always see the links for the services, regardless of whether they are actually offered by the host. Never means that you will never have the links to the services. In both cases you will not contact the host, so nobody will ever regard you as an attacker. More information about LISa can be found at the LISa Homepage or contact Alexander Neundorf & lt; neundorf@kde. org gt;.

A hidden ladder will appear as you collect the last nugget. The hero, at the top left, is your deputy. To collect the nuggets, just point the mouse where you want him to go.

Here you can choose the languages that will be used by KDE. If the first language in the list is not available, the second will be used, etc. If only US English is available, no translations have been installed. You can get translation packages for many languages from the place you got KDE from. Note that some applications may not be translated to your languages; in this case, they will automatically fall back to US English.

Enhanced Browsing In this module you can configure some enhanced browsing features of KDE. Web Shortcuts Web Shortcuts are a quick way of using Web search engines. For example, type "altavista: frobozz" or "av: frobozz" and Konqueror will do a search on AltaVista for "frobozz". Even easier: just press Alt+F2 (if you have not changed this shortcut) and enter the shortcut in the KDE Run Command dialog.

This list shows the configurable component types. Click the component you want to configure. In this dialog you can change KDE default components. Components are programs that handle basic tasks, like the terminal emulator, the text editor and the email client. Different KDE applications sometimes need to invoke a console emulator, send a mail or display some text. To do so consistently, these applications always call the same components. Here you can select which programs these components are.

After you finished your moves, they have to be sent to the engine. You can either do that manually (in which case you should not enable this feature), or you can specify an amount of time that has to pass before the move is committed. If you undo a move during the timeout, the timeout will be reset and restarted once you finish the move. This is very useful if you would like to review the result of your move.

Preview Options Here you can modify the behavior of Konqueror when it shows the files in a folder. The list of protocols: check the protocols over which previews should be shown; uncheck those over which they should not. For instance, you might want to show previews over SMB if the local network is fast enough, but you might disable it for FTP if you often visit very slow FTP sites with large images. Maximum File Size: select the maximum file size for which previews should be generated. For instance, if set to 1 MB (the default), no preview will be generated for files bigger than 1 MB, for speed reasons.

When you have a number in the current cell and you switch from the dcell format from Generic to Percent, the current cell number will be multiplied by 100%. For example if you enter 12 and set the cell format to Percent, the number will then be 1,200%. Switching back to Generic cell format will bring it back to 12. You can also use the Percent icon in the Format Toolbar.

This selects which mailbox format will be the default for local folders: mbox: KMail's mail folders are represented by a single file each. Individual messages are separated from each other by a line starting with "From". This saves space on disk, but may be less robust, e. g. when moving messages between folders. maildir: KMail's mail folders are represented by real folders on disk. Individual messages are separate files. This may waste a bit of space on disk, but should be more robust, e. g. when moving messages between folders.

This tutorial is a collection of easy levels that teaches you the rules of KGoldrunner and helps you develop the skills you need to get started. It uses the Traditional set of rules, similar to those used on early home-computers. Each level has a brief explanation, then you play... When you move on to play more advanced levels, you will find that KGoldrunner combines action, strategy and puzzle solving --- all in one game.

This setting defines which users sharing this folder should get "busy" periods in their freebusy lists and should see the alarms for the events or tasks in this folder. The setting applies to Calendar and Task folders only (for tasks, this setting is only used for alarms). Example use cases: if the boss shares a folder with his secretary, only the boss should be marked as busy for his meetings, so he should select "Admins", since the secretary has no admin rights on the folder. On the other hand if a working group shares a Calendar for group meetings, all readers of the folders should be marked as busy for meetings. A company-wide folder with optional events in it would use "Nobody" since it is not known who will go to those events.

Repeatedly rotates a bitmap by 90 degrees by using logical operations: the bitmap is divided into quadrants, and the quadrants are shifted clockwise. Then the same thing is done again with progressively smaller quadrants, except that all sub-quadrants of a given size are rotated in parallel. As you watch it, the image appears to dissolve into static and then reconstitute itself, but rotated. Written by Jamie Zawinski; 1992.

Key Bindings Using key bindings you can configure certain actions to be triggered when you press a key or a combination of keys, e. g. Ctrl+C is normally bound to'Copy '. KDE allows you to store more than one'scheme' of key bindings, so you might want to experiment a little setting up your own scheme while you can still change back to the KDE defaults. In the tab'Global Shortcuts' you can configure non-application specific bindings like how to switch desktops or maximize a window. In the tab'Application Shortcuts' you will find bindings typically used in applications, such as copy and paste.

List of all Callees This list shows all functions called by the current selected one, either directly or with several function in-between on the stack; the number of function in-between plus one is called the Distance (e. g. for function A, B, C there exists a call from A to C when A calls B and B calls C, i. e. A = > B = > C. The distance here is 2). Absolute cost shown is the cost spent in the listed function while the selected is active; relative cost is the percentage of all cost spent in the listed function while the selected one is active. The cost graphic always shows logarithmic percentage with a different color for each distance. As there can be many calls to the same function, the distance column sometimes shows the range of distances for all calls happening; then, in parentheses, there is the medium distance, i. e. the distance where most of the call costs happened. Selecting a function makes it the current selected one of this information panel. If there are two panels (Split mode), the function of the other panel is changed instead.

This generates random cloud-like patterns. The idea is to take four points on the edge of the image, and assign each a random "elevation". Then find the point between them, and give it a value which is the average of the other four, plus some small random offset. Coloration is done based on elevation. Written by Juergen Nickelsen and Jamie Zawinski; 1992.

The maximum number of "tiles" that are kept in memory. For regular RGBA8 images, each tile is about 16 kB in size. Thus, for a value of 500 tiles this usually means about 8 megabytes are used for image data. If you regularly handle large images, a greater value here might be useful. Note that this number is only a guideline for Krita, and is not guaranteed to be the actual number of tiles in memory.

Detect recursive cycles If this is switched off, the treemap drawing will show black areas when a recursive call is made instead of drawing the recursion ad infinitum. Note that the size of black areas often will be wrong, as inside recursive cycles the cost of calls cannot be determined; the error is small, however, for false cycles (see documentation). The correct handling for cycles is to detect them and collapse all functions of a cycle into an artificial function, which is done when this option is selected. Unfortunately, with GUI applications, this often will lead to huge false cycles, making the analysis impossible; therefore, there is the option to switch this off.

If you are using SCSI emulation (possible if you have an IDE CD writer) then make sure you check that you have read and write permissions on the generic SCSI device, which is probably / dev/ sg0, / dev/ sg1, etc.. If it still does not work, try typing audiocd: / ?device=/ dev/ sg0 (or similar) to tell kio_audiocd which device your CD-ROM is.

Trace Part List This list shows all trace parts of the loaded trace. For each part, the self/ inclusive cost of the current selected function, spent in the part, is shown; percentage costs are always relative to the total cost of the part (not to the whole trace as in the Trace Part Overview). Also shown are the calls happening to/ from the current function inside of the trace part. By choosing one or more trace parts from the list, the costs shown all over KCachegrind will only be the ones spent in the selected part(s). If no list selection is shown, in fact all trace parts are selected implicitly. This is a multi-selection list. You can select ranges by dragging the mouse or use SHIFT/ CTRL modifiers. Selection/ Deselection of trace parts can also be done by using the Trace Part Overview Dockable. This one also supports multiple selection. Note that the list is hidden if only one trace part is loaded.

PulseAudio is a sound server for POSIX and Win32 systems. A sound server is basically a proxy for your sound applications. It allows you to do advanced operations on your sound data as it passes between your application and your hardware. Things like transferring the audio to a different machine, changing the sample format or channel count and mixing several sounds into one are easily achieved using a sound server.

Call Graph around active Function Depending on configuration, this view shows the call graph environment of the active function. Note: the shown cost is only the cost which is spent while the active function was actually running; i. e. the cost shown for main() - if it is visible - should be the same as the cost of the active function, as that is the part of inclusive cost of main() spent while the active function was running. For cycles, blue call arrows indicate that this is an artificial call added for correct drawing which actually never happened. If the graph is larger than the widget area, an overview panner is shown in one edge. There are similar visualization options to the Call Treemap; the selected function is highlighted.

Here you can change the component program. Components are programs that handle basic tasks, like the terminal emulator, the text editor and the email client. Different KDE applications sometimes need to invoke a console emulator, send a mail or display some text. To do so consistently, these applications always call the same components. You can choose here which programs these components are.

The transport encoding of this part: normally, you do not need to change this, since %1 will use a decent default encoding, depending on the MIME type; yet, sometimes, you can significantly reduce the size of the resulting message, e. g. if a PostScript file does not contain binary data, but consists of pure text -- in this case, choosing "quoted-printable" over the default "base64" will save up to 25% in resulting message size.

The server does not seem to support pipelining; therefore, this option has been disabled. Since some servers do not correctly announce their capabilities you still have the possibility to turn pipelining on. But please note that this feature can cause some POP servers that do not support pipelining to send corrupt messages. So before using this feature with important mail you should first test it by sending yourself a larger number of test messages which you all download in one go from the POP server.

You can also hide the cell formula in order to protect the way you calculate the formula. This also needs to enable sheet protection to work. You can hide the cell content with Hide all and again this needs sheet protection. You can learn more about all these settings in the User Manual in the Advanced KSpread chapter.

Joystick This module helps to check if your joystick is working correctly. If it delivers wrong values for the axes, you can try to solve this with the calibration. This module tries to find all available joystick devices by checking / dev/ js[0-4] and / dev/ input/ js[0-4] If you have another device file, enter it in the combobox. The Buttons list shows the state of the buttons on your joystick, the Axes list shows the current value for all axes. NOTE: the current Linux device driver (Kernel 2.4, 2.6) can only autodetect 2-axis, 4-button joystick 3-axis, 4-button joystick 4-axis, 4-button joystick Saitek Cyborg'digital 'joysticks (For details you can check your Linux source/ Documentation/ input/ joystick. txt)

Troubleshooting the IMAP Cache If you have problems with synchronizing an IMAP folder, you should first try rebuilding the index file. This will take some time to rebuild, but will not cause any problems. If that is not enough, you can try refreshing the IMAP cache. If you do this, you will lose all your local changes for this folder and all its subfolders.

This draws set of animating, transparent, amoeba-like blobs. The blobs change shape as they wander around the screen, and they are translucent, so you can see the lower blobs through the higher ones, and when one passes over another, their colors merge. I got the idea for this from a mouse pad I had once, which achieved the same kind of effect in real life by having several layers of plastic with colored oil between them. Written by Jamie Zawinski; 1997.

Various applications may attempt to use the KDE wallet to store passwords or other information such as web form data and cookies. If you would like these applications to use the wallet, you must enable it now and choose a password. The password you choose cannot be recovered if it is lost, and will allow anyone who knows it to obtain all the information contained in the wallet.

The KDE Wallet system stores your data in a wallet file on your local hard disk. The data is only written in encrypted form, presently using the blowfish algorithm with your password as the key. When a wallet is opened, the wallet manager application will launch and display an icon in the system tray. You can use this application to manage your wallets. It even permits you to drag wallets and wallet contents, allowing you to easily copy a wallet to a remote system.

List of Emails
The column to the left of the 1 requires a quick run down and back up, with careful dodging both ways to avoid the enemies. To get the gold in the middle of the 6, drop down on the top of the'O 'part of the 6, move right/ dig left and immediately move left and dig left to delay the enemy who otherwise is likely to catch you. However, you may wish to leave this piece of gold to the end so as not to free two additional enemies earlier; it is possible to get two enemies to retrap themselves in that section, though. To get the gold held by enemies in the bottom right, dig out the blocking square to their left, run up the ladder, dig off the right side of the 6, drop in, run left and dig off a square on the left side of the 6 and drop to the floor. The timing is tight - only one or two enemies in the bottom right section will be able to move to the next section to the left. You will still need to dig out the bottom of the 6 to get their gold, but that is straightforward albeit a bit hectic because of the enemies lingering to the left of the 6. Once you have gotten all the gold, you may find it easiest to exit by passing through the middle false floor on the 1 and exiting via the ladders on the left of the 1.
The DAYS360() function returns the number of days from date1 to date2 using a 360-day calendar in which all months are assumed to have 30 days. If method is false (default) the US method will be used, the European otherwise.

Draws quasiperiodic tilings; think of the implications on modern formica technology. In April 1997, Sir Roger Penrose, a British math professor who has worked with Stephen Hawking on such topics as relativity, black holes, and whether time has a beginning, filed a copyright-infringement lawsuit against the Kimberly-Clark Corporation, which Penrose said copied a pattern he created (a pattern demonstrating that "a nonrepeating pattern could exist in nature") for its Kleenex quilted toilet paper. Penrose said he does n't like litigation but, "When it comes to the population of Great Britain being invited by a multinational to wipe their bottoms on what appears to be the work of a Knight of the Realm, then a last stand must be taken." As reported by News of the Weird #491, 4-Jul-1997. http: / /en. wikipedia. org/ wiki/ Penrose_tiling Written by Timo Korvola; 1997.

Damping: this control sets the phase-jitter damping adjustment. This value defines how fast the adaptive filter-radius reacts to luminance variations. If increased, then edges appear smoother; if too high, then blur may occur. If at minimum, then noise and phase jitter at the edges can occur. It can suppress spike noise when increased, and this is the preferred method to remove it.

The SYD() function will calculate the sum-of-years digits depreciation for an asset based on its cost, salvage value, anticipated life, and a particular period. This method accelerates the rate of the depreciation, so that more depreciation expense occurs in earlier periods than in later ones. The depreciable cost is the actual cost minus the salvage value. The useful life is the number of periods (typically years) over which the asset is depreciated.

Appearance options can be found in the in the context menu. To get exact size proportions, choose'Hide incorrect borders'. As this mode can be very time consuming, you may want to limit the maximum drawn nesting level before. 'Best 'determinates the split direction for children from the aspect ratio of the parent. 'Always Best' decides on remaining space for each sibling. 'Ignore Proportions' takes space for function name drawing before drawing children. Note that size proportions can get heavily wrong. This is a TreeMap widget. Keyboard navigation is available with the left/ right arrow keys for traversing siblings, and up/ down arrow keys to go a nesting level up/ down. Return activates the current item.

Some mail advertisements are in HTML and contain references to, for example, images that the advertisers employ to find out that you have read their message ("web bugs"). There is no valid reason to load images off the Internet like this, since the sender can always attach the required images directly to the message. To guard from such a misuse of the HTML displaying feature of KMail, this option is disabled by default. However, if you wish to, for example, view images in HTML messages that were not attached to it, you can enable this option, but you should be aware of the possible problem.

This is just a nice easy level to finish up with. Have fun with the other games in KGoldrunner. Note that there is a game Editor in which you and your friends can make up levels and challenge each other. And if you like action, the KGoldrunner rules used in some of the games are fast and furious. There is also a KGoldrunner Handbook in the Help Menu, which contains more detail than this Tutorial. It has been a pleasure showing you around. Bye!

If you have a TFT or LCD screen you can further improve the quality of displayed fonts by selecting this option. Sub-pixel rendering is also known as ClearType(tm). In order for sub-pixel rendering to work correctly you need to know how the sub-pixels of your display are aligned. On TFT or LCD displays a single pixel is actually composed of three sub-pixels, red, green and blue. Most displays have a linear ordering of RGB sub-pixel, some have BGR. This feature does not work with CRT monitors.

Anti-alias threshold:
The fraction format changes your number into a fraction. For example, 0.1 can be changed to 1/ 8, 2/ 16, 1/ 10, etc. You define the type of fraction by choosing it in the field on the right. If the exact fraction is not possible in the fraction mode you choose, the nearest closest match is chosen. For example: when we have 1.5 as number, we choose Fraction and Sixteenths 1/ 16 the text displayed into cell is "1 8/ 16" which is an exact fraction. If you have 1.4 as number in your cell and you choose Fraction and Sixteenths 1/ 16 then the cell will display "1 6/ 16" which is the nearest closest Sixteenth fraction.

Comma-separated list of tags that define this DTEP. The format used is tagname(attribute[defaultvalue]). If the parent (a real) DTEP has a tag with tagname and the attribute value of this tag is equal with the name of this DTEP, the tag area is parsed according to the rules of this DTEP. If [defaultvalue] is present, it means that if the attribute is not present in the tag it is taken as present with value = defaultvalue. Example: Tags=style(type[text/ css]) means that both lt; stylegt; and lt; stylenbsp; type="text/ css"gt; are treated the same way and the DTEP defined by this tag is named text/ css.
