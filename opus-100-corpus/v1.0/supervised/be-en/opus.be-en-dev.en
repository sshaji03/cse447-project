An icon instead of an inclusive cost specifies that this is a call inside of a recursive cycle. An inclusive cost makes no sense here. Selecting a function makes it the current selected one of this information panel. If there are two panels (Split mode), the function of the other panel is changed instead.

The FV_ANNUITY() function returns the future value of a stream of payments given the amount of the payment, the interest rate and the number of periods. For example: If you receive $500 per year for 20 years, and invest it at 8%, the total after 20 years will be FV_annuity(500; 0.08; 20) or $22,880.98. This function assumes that payments are made at the end of each period.
