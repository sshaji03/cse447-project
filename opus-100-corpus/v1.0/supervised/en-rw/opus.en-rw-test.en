Notifications are actions that & konversation; will perform whenever an event occurs.

Unfortunately, there is a drawback on volume accounting. & kppp; will only count the number of bytes, regardless of their origin. Many providers set their limit only for Internet access, and not for data on their own network. Some providers set different limits for data that is on their own network, in the same country, and coming from overseas. So, if you're doing not much websurfing, and getting most of your pages from your ISP's own proxy cache, then your provider is probably not charging you for that data. & kppp; will not know these IP packets are coming from the proxy, and so it will count them. So if you this situation applies to you, or, as another example, your provider uses a caching news server such as nntpcached, then the volume reported by & kppp; may be higher than the amount you are going to be billed for. On the bright side, at least & kppp; will never underestimate your bills.

If there are other enhancements that can help using GNUbg from & kbackgammon;, please contact the author of & kbackgammon; (or better: send a patch). Some of the more advanced features will probably be position analysis and save/ restore functions. However, playing is the most pressing issue.

There also is a button "Automatically go to next unsolved conflict after source selection" (Auto-Advance). If you enable this, then, when one source is selected, & kdiff3; will jump to and select the next unsolved conflict automatically. This can help when you always want to choose one source only. When you need both sources, or you want to edit after selecting, then you probably want to switch this off. Before proceeding to the next unsolved conflict & kdiff3; shows you the effect of your choice for a short time. This delay is adjustable in the Diff- & Merge-Settings: You can specify the "Auto-Advance delay" in milli seconds between 0 and 2000. Hint: Tired of many clicks? - Use a small Auto-Advance-delay and the shortcuts Ctrl-1/ 2/ 3 to select A/ B/ C for many conflicts.

Saves the current game, level, lives and score. The option will only save the position and score as at the start of the current level. You can save when you are mid-way through a level, but & kgoldrunner; will still save the position (and score) as it was at the start of the level. You will receive a warning message about that. Before using this option, you should press a Pause key (P or & Esc;), to freeze the game as you move the mouse, but it is much easier to use the S key as a short-cut.

You should select the one that matches the character set you are using. In some cases, dictionaries will support more than one encoding.

Please see your dictionary's distribution for more information.
