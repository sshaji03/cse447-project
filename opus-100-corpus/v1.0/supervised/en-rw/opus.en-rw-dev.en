When the MapExpressionToVolumeEvents option is set in the map file, and a midi file try to send an expression event, & kmid; will send a volume event which is understood by more non-GM keyboards, and which has a similar effect. There are many midi files which use expression events to fade out at the end of a song, so if you feel that music should be heard softer and softer, you can turn on this option and see if this is what you need, because your midi synthesizer could be ignoring the expression events because it does n't understand them.

Mod3 is played with two card decks. The goal is to put all cards on the top three rows. In those you have to build sequences of the same color. In the first row you have to create the sequence 2-5-8-B, in the second row the sequence 3-6-9-D, and in the third row the sequence 4-7-10-K. The suit of the cards must be the same in each sequence, so you can only put a five of hearts on top of a two of hearts.

The tag chooser lets & juk; know what tag you want to search for the text in. If you choose the special tag "lt; All Visiblegt;", then any tag that you can see in the Collection List listing is fair game to match the search text.

Is that all the core concepts in & kommander;? No, but it should help you to make sense of how it works so that what is covered does not look like a foreign language to you. There are a few more. Signals and slots are how & kommander; handles events. An event in a program basically means something happened like a widget was created or had its text changed. These changes emit signals and you can connect those signals to a receiving slot which will then do something when the event happens. One use of this in & kommander; is the sibling of & kommander; Text, Population Text. Population Text will populate a widget when called. Just like & kommander; Text, Population Text can contain text strings or scripts.

CVS and other version control systems use several keywords to insert automatically generated strings (info: / cvs/ Keyword substitution). All of them follow the pattern "$KEYWORD generated text$". We now need a Line-Matching-Preprocessor-Command that removes only the generated text: sed's/ \\$\\(Revision\\_BAR_Author\\_BAR_Log\\_BAR_Header\\_BAR_Date\\). *\\$/ \\$\\1\\$/ 'The "\\_BAR_" separates the possible keywords. You might want to modify this list according to your needs. The "\\" before the "$" is necessary because otherwise the "$" matches the end of the line.
