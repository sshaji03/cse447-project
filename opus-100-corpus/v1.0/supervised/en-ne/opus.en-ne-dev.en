Speed tradeoff for when to show a file as a thumbnail. If set to "always" then always thumbnail, even if the folder is on a remote server. If set to "local-only" then only show thumbnails for local file systems. If set to "never" then never bother to thumbnail files, just use a generic icon. Despite what the name may suggest, this applies to any previewable file type.

List of direct Callers This list shows all functions calling the current selected one directly, together with a call count and the cost spent in the current selected function while being called from the function from the list. An icon instead of an inclusive cost specifies that this is a call inside of a recursive cycle. An inclusive cost makes no sense here. Selecting a function makes it the current selected one of this information panel. If there are two panels (Split mode), the function of the other panel is changed instead.

Format syntax: A format is a string that will be output for each package. The format can include the standard escape sequences \ (newline), \\r (carriage return) or \\\\ (plain backslash). Package information can be included by inserting variable references to package fields using the ${var[;width]} syntax. Fields will be right-aligned unless the width is negative in which case left alignment will be used.
Set to true to enable warning icons when too many flags are placed.
