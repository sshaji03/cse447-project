All executable files in this folder will appear in the Scripts menu. Choosing a script from the menu will run that script. When executed from a local folder, scripts will be passed the selected file names. When executed from a remote folder (e.g. a folder showing web or ftp content), scripts will be passed no parameters. In all cases, the following environment variables will be set by Nautilus, which the scripts may use: NAUTILUS_SCRIPT_SELECTED_FILE_PATHS: newline-delimited paths for selected files (only if local) NAUTILUS_SCRIPT_SELECTED_URIS: newline-delimited URIs for selected files NAUTILUS_SCRIPT_CURRENT_URI: URI for current location NAUTILUS_SCRIPT_WINDOW_GEOMETRY: position and size of current window NAUTILUS_SCRIPT_NEXT_PANE_SELECTED_FILE_PATHS: newline-delimited paths for selected files in the inactive pane of a split-view window (only if local) NAUTILUS_SCRIPT_NEXT_PANE_SELECTED_URIS: newline-delimited URIs for selected files in the inactive pane of a split-view window NAUTILUS_SCRIPT_NEXT_PANE_CURRENT_URI: URI for current location in the inactive pane of a split-view window
