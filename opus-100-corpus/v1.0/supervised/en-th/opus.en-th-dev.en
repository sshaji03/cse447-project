He's gotta be local.
Each one special, like Jake.

We can all help you.
And let's just say... It was troubling.
That's why I think you're so cute.
I will resign.
That's emotion, Elena. That's humanity.
She farted so hard, the whole bed shook. [farting noises] Seems a bit greedy for one man to have so many wives.
Walking around alone on an ice planet.
What-What kid?

This fool...
Get me down. Please?
Oh. We brought beer.
Come on, man, we'll have our own ditch day.
Cool.
Because I'm the one that's in control here.
You cut 'em out, and you don't look back.
Sorry, we should have clarified.

I'm going in. I'll be out in five minutes.
Yes.Yeah,you-you mentioned it.
Or men. So that I don't have to, like--
Isn't this too romantic?
You'll meet with a solicitor, make a statement... have it signed, witnessed, send copies to us.
You can rest in the clean environment, ride horses and row boats.
Can we.. hook up in town..
We're not late are we?
I like "Tree of Silence."
You went after him with a warrant, but he charged at you...
Oh, nightcaps! I'd forgotten all about nightcaps.

You need to give it time, Niklaus.
My hero, Mack Tannen, told me I was the worst journalist he'd ever seen.
So you want to help her?
The rest will be up to Mr. Lawton.

Wow. A model and a poet.
- I'm not ashamed to be a servant. I'm not a liar.
Maybe one day, I'll get to return the favor.
Yeah, guys, we have an address. 1503 Hope street.
She took to my blood like a kitten to milk. Did you know that I haven't turned anyone since I last saw you?
Betraying my father with rufus humphrey. I did no such thing.
Oh, Kim Minjung.

Hey, it's not her fault. You're right, it's yours.
Hey,drink up.
Anyway, thanks for calling me
I wonder where she got this.
